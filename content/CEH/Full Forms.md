# **Differences**
## Difference between IPS and IDS.
An IDS is designed to only provide an alert about a potential incident, which enables a security operations center (SOC) analyst to investigate the event and determine whether it requires further action. An IPS, on the other hand, takes action itself to block the attempted intrusion or otherwise remediate the incident.


## Difference between XSS, SSTI & CSRF.

| **Vulnerability Type**                    | **What It Is**                                                                                   | **How It Works**                                                                                                                                             | **Example**                                                                                      |

| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**            | Occurs when malicious scripts are injected into web content served to users.                     | An attacker injects a script that runs in other users' browsers, potentially stealing cookies or taking actions on behalf of the user.                       | A comment field on a blog allows script injection that steals cookies from other users.          |
| **SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)** | Occurs when malicious code is injected into a server-side template engine.                       | User input is improperly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject code that executes on the server, potentially leading to code execution or data exposure. | An attacker injects code into a template field that lets them read server files.                 |
| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**     | Tricks a victim into making unwanted requests to a web application where they are authenticated. | An attacker crafts a request that includes the victim’s credentials (like cookies), causing unintended actions on a site where the victim is logged in.      | A fake form causes a logged-in user to change their account email address without their consent. |
### Summary:
- **XSS** targets users by injecting scripts into web pages they view.
- **SSTI** targets the server by injecting malicious code into server-side templates.
- **CSRF** targets authenticated users by tricking them into making unintended requests to a web application.
